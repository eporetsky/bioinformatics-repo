# RNA-seq Analysis Snakemake Workflows
The main workflow right now is "sra2counts.smk" to get feature-count files and\ 
genozip compressed bams from a specified SRA BioProject ID\
The paired-end workflow should be working and single-end will be implemented soon\

I will continue working on the other workflows.
